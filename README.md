## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Working on this challenge helped me strengthen key concepts, such as using CSS variables to maintain consistency in colors and fonts, and understanding how organize a design using flexbox


```html
<h1 class="main-tittle">Simple Omelette Recipe</h1>
```
```css
.main-tittle{
    font-family: var(--font-primary);
    font-weight: 400;
    max-lines: 2;
    word-wrap: break-word;
}
```

### Continued development

Improve accessibility: use correct labels 
Responsive optimizations: Implement more media queries to improve the experience on large devices.
CSS good practices: Incorporate methodologies such as BEM for a more structured CSS code.
